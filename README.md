# Automated-Grading-System
Submission for MLH Month Long November Hackathon
Created by Praggya, during the month of November.

This is my first AI hackathon project, I want to make something useful and practical. Time is a constraint because I have started late. I want to improve on this project later when I have more time and skills.

### Problem Statement
This system is able to grade essays on its own. The inspiration is drawn from a Kaggle competition held few years back The Hewlett Foundation: Automated Essay Scoring
